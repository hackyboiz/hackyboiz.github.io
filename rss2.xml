      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2 id="Introduction"><a href="#Introduction" class="headerlink" title="Introduction"></a>Introduction</h2><p>Hello! It&#x2019;s ogu123, back on COM after a long time!</p><p>I was busy with other things, but I wanted to find a vulnerability on COM and wrap things up, so I&#x2019;m back..!</p><p>Today I&#x2019;ve prepared a <a href="https://www.usenix.org/conference/usenixsecurity23/presentation/zhang-yuxing">paper review on COM</a>. It mentions that using union variables in a COM server can lead to type confusion? Let&#x2019;s take a closer look!</p><h2 id="Background"><a href="#Background" class="headerlink" title="Background"></a>Background</h2><p><img src="/2025/08/28/ogu123/Detecting%20Union%20Type%20Confusion%20in%20Component%20Object%20Model/EN/2.png" alt></p><blockquote><p>reference: Struct VS Union (Introduction to Unions in C - Youtube) </p></blockquote><p>First, a union is a user-defined type where all member variables share the same memory location!</p><p>Looking at the picture above makes it easy to understand, right? As shown in the picture , member variables declared within a union share a single memory space, so a union can only store one member variable at a time!</p><p>So why use a union instead of a struct? Since a union allocates memory based on the size of its largest member variable, it can be useful when memory is limited!</p><p>COM is a technology introduced in 1993. To conserve memory for past system performance, COM developers reportedly used unions extensively instead of structs.</p><p>Even now, 30 years later, COM remains the foundation for core Microsoft technologies like OLE, ActiveX, and Windows Shell. However, the paper states that the union type confusion problem persists from past COM development.</p><p>Therefore, this paper proposes COMFUSION to detect union type confusion in COM.</p><p>First, to find union type confusion in COM, the paper researched how unions are presented in COM and the conventions under which they are used.</p><p><img src="/2025/08/28/ogu123/Detecting%20Union%20Type%20Confusion%20in%20Component%20Object%20Model/EN/3.png" alt></p><p>In Windows 10 (versions 1803 and 21H2) and Windows 11 (version 21H2), after exploring and collecting all custom structures in COM that are connected to or directly/indirectly referenced by unions via MS COM code and documentation, it was determined that the general union declaration form was defined as shown above.</p><p>Figure 1 illustrates the three representative union forms in COM.</p><ol><li>Non-encapsulated Union<ul><li>The basic form where only the union is used alone</li></ul></li><li>Encapsulated Union<ul><li>Enclosing the union within a struct or class and adding a selector member variable</li></ul></li><li>Re-encapsulated Union<ul><li>A form where an encapsulated union is included as a struct member; viewing only the struct reveals no direct use of the union, but it exists indirectly</li></ul></li></ol><p>Here, the Selector member variable serves as a selector to determine the type of a union variable before using its value!</p><p><img src="/2025/08/28/ogu123/Detecting%20Union%20Type%20Confusion%20in%20Component%20Object%20Model/EN/4.png" alt></p><p>Looking at the figure above, you can see that 34&#x2013;35% of the custom structures are unions. You can also see that the three union types examined earlier are used in combination.</p><p><img src="/2025/08/28/ogu123/Detecting%20Union%20Type%20Confusion%20in%20Component%20Object%20Model/EN/5.png" alt></p><p>Then, let&#x2019;s examine a simple example in Figure 3 to see how union type confusion can occur.</p><p>First, the union MetaInfo consists of a string pointer and an integer member. In the main function, the value of user.info.name is printed using a for loop. At this point, the type value of UserInfo, which acts as the discriminator, should be checked first. However, without this step, the integer value is used as a string pointer, causing type confusion.</p><p>Over 50% of COM&#x2019;s custom unions use both pointer and non-pointer members together, which can lead to potential issues like those shown in Figure 3.</p><p>Suppose a client can send values from the users array to the server via a specific COM interface. In this case, the client performs marshaling to convert the calling COM interface and arguments according to IDL (Interface Definition Language) rules before transmitting the data.</p><p>The server receiving the marshaled data obtains the original data through unmarshaling, enabling execution on the server side. Here, we will explore IDL and marshaling.</p><p><img src="/2025/08/28/ogu123/Detecting%20Union%20Type%20Confusion%20in%20Component%20Object%20Model/EN/6.png" alt></p><p>First, IDL is a language that defines the interfaces and functions possessed by a COM server, as shown in the figure above. Since IDL itself is a language, it is compiled using the MIDL compiler created by Microsoft to generate .dil files. This process yields header files, type libraries, and files for Proxy and Stub, enabling continued COM development.</p><p>Earlier, we mentioned that marshaling follows IDL rules. Therefore, while the client must adhere to IDL rules when sending data to the server, if the server fails to properly validate the data (such as argument values) received from the client, COM type confusion occurs, as shown in Figure 3.</p><p>Simply put, marshaling does all the work, but if the server side doesn&#x2019;t do its part, it&#x2019;s all for naught.</p><h2 id="Design-of-COMFUSION"><a href="#Design-of-COMFUSION" class="headerlink" title="Design of COMFUSION"></a>Design of COMFUSION</h2><p><img src="/2025/08/28/ogu123/Detecting%20Union%20Type%20Confusion%20in%20Component%20Object%20Model/EN/7.png" alt></p><p>Now let&#x2019;s examine the workflow of the COMFUSION tool, which explores type confusion vulnerabilities in numerous COM binaries within Windows, as shown in Figure 3!</p><p>The goal of COMFUSION is to efficiently and accurately detect union type confusion in COM binaries! Let&#x2019;s look at it step by step!</p><h3 id="1-Extracting-COM-Objects"><a href="#1-Extracting-COM-Objects" class="headerlink" title="1. Extracting COM Objects"></a>1. Extracting COM Objects</h3><p><img src="/2025/08/28/ogu123/Detecting%20Union%20Type%20Confusion%20in%20Component%20Object%20Model/EN/8.png" alt></p><p>First, obtain all CLSIDs and their corresponding COM binaries from the Windows registry using the path below.</p><ul><li>HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT/CLSID/$CLSID/InprocServer32</li><li>HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT/CLSID/$CLSID/LocalServer32</li></ul><p>It is said that you can recover the MIDL file by analyzing the marshaling rules of the COM object using oleviewdotnet.</p><p>Finally, each interface can be accessed via a pointer with a specific interface pointer identifier (IPID). Since all IPIDs are organized in a table called the IPIDTable within the COM server process&#x2019;s memory space, it is also possible to parse the IPIDTable using oleviewdotnet and calculate the offset of each interface function table after the COM server has started.</p><h3 id="2-Exploring-Union-Declarations"><a href="#2-Exploring-Union-Declarations" class="headerlink" title="2. Exploring Union Declarations"></a>2. Exploring Union Declarations</h3><p>To detect union type confusion, information is required about the variable acting as a discriminator, valid discriminator values, and union members; however, this information can be obtained from the previously recovered MIDL file.</p><p><img src="/2025/08/28/ogu123/Detecting%20Union%20Type%20Confusion%20in%20Component%20Object%20Model/EN/9.png" alt></p><p>Algorithm1 is used to analyze the relationships between user-defined structures declared in MIDL files.</p><p>A simplified overview of Algorithm1 involves creating all structs and unions within the MIDL file as nodes in a graph. If structure <code>u</code> contains another structure <code>v</code> as a variable or pointer, an edge is created from <code>u</code> to <code>v</code>.</p><p>It then assigns labels based on the previously discussed Non-encapsulated Union, encapsulated Union, etc., and identifies the discriminator according to the union type&#x2026; &#x2190; We will examine this content immediately below.</p><p>As a result of Algorithm1, a DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph) is constructed as shown in Figure 5 below.</p><p><img src="/2025/08/28/ogu123/Detecting%20Union%20Type%20Confusion%20in%20Component%20Object%20Model/EN/10.png" alt></p><p>When examining the DAG, you&#x2019;ll see System Defined Union - VARIANT. VARIANT functions similarly to a union, but internally, the data type is specified in a field called vt. Therefore, just as you must first check the discriminator value to use a union correctly, you must also check the VARIANT&#x2192; vt value before using the data in a VARIANT.</p><p>In union type confusion, finding the discriminator of a union variable is crucial. This paper categorizes them based on the union form as follows</p><ol><li>Encapsulated Union<ul><li>Variables located immediately before the union declaration are recognized as discriminators</li></ul></li><li>System Defined Union<ul><li>The vt member variable of VARIANT is recognized as a discriminator</li></ul></li><li>Re-encapsulated Union<ul><li>As shown in Figure 6, if a VARIANT type exists in Struct_20, the discriminator for Struct_20 is recognized as Member10&#x2192;vt</li></ul></li></ol><p>When recognizing a discriminator, it is important to know the values that discriminator can hold. For VARIANT, I referred to the MS documentation, and for other union types, I used the case list for the union variable, which was commented out in the recovered MIDL file.</p><p><img src="/2025/08/28/ogu123/Detecting%20Union%20Type%20Confusion%20in%20Component%20Object%20Model/EN/11.png" alt></p><p>Figure 6 shows an example of a recovered MIDL file. Theoretically, union type confusion checks should be performed for all functions using union variables, but&#x2026; analyzing every function in the COM binary to find union variables is inefficient. There are simply too many&#x2026;</p><p>Therefore, COMFUSION only checks functions that are directly or indirectly called by interface functions using union variables as arguments, as declared in the MIDL file. Function arguments are designated as taint sources, and CONFUSION distinguishes between union member taint and discriminant taint during analysis.</p><p>Referring to Figure 6, each function argument has the [IN], [OUT], or [IN, OUT] attribute. Only [IN] and [IN, OUT] attributes, where an attacker can send data, are subject to Taint Source Filtering.</p><p>Additionally, COMFUSION utilizes Angr to set specific variables as tainted. It then tracks whether these tainted variables flow into other variables or memory at the instruction level. <a href="https://hackyboiz.github.io/2021/07/10/j0ker/angr_part1/">For more details on Angr, please refer to the blog!</a></p><h3 id="3-Locate-Union-Variables"><a href="#3-Locate-Union-Variables" class="headerlink" title="3. Locate Union Variables"></a>3. Locate Union Variables</h3><p><img src="/2025/08/28/ogu123/Detecting%20Union%20Type%20Confusion%20in%20Component%20Object%20Model/EN/12.png" alt></p><p>Algorithm 2 demonstrates how COMFUSION finds union variables step by step.</p><p>First, as seen in MAIN, COMFUSION uses DFS (Depth-First Search) when exploring execution paths. For interface functions with multiple union arguments, COMFUSION taints only one argument at a time.</p><p>One complex situation during analysis is handling function calls. COMFUSION addresses this by processing functions in the following four scenarios</p><ol><li>Summarized functions<ul><li>Functions like <code>memcpy</code> and <code>strcpy</code> update the taint map by applying predefined rules without analyzing their internal code.</li></ul></li><li>Internal functions<ul><li>Functions implemented within the analyzed binary. The analysis enters these functions, tracks taint, and updates the taint map.</li></ul></li><li>External functions<ul><li>Functions implemented outside the analyzed binary. These functions are skipped and not analyzed. It is assumed that taint disappears at this point.</li></ul></li><li>Address-taken functions<ul><li>Functions whose call address is determined at runtime. These are skipped due to their high complexity.</li></ul></li></ol><p>Additionally, COMFUSION has set the following thresholds to address three potential issues that may arise during binary analysis:</p><ol><li>LOOP_THOLD (infinite loop prevention): 2</li><li>CALL_THOLD (function recursion/depth issues): 5</li><li>TOTAL_THOLD (analysis time): 10,000</li></ol><h3 id="4-Identify-Union-Type-Confusion"><a href="#4-Identify-Union-Type-Confusion" class="headerlink" title="4. Identify Union Type Confusion"></a>4. Identify Union Type Confusion</h3><p>Union type confusion occurs when a union variable is used and its discriminator can represent multiple types. In other words, it arises when there is uncertainty about the specific type of data stored within.</p><p>Previously, we discussed how taint propagation identifies the origin of data. By converting variables and discriminators into symbolic representations through symbolic execution, we can analyze all possible program paths to determine which variables are discriminators and which are union variables.</p><p>Therefore, before program execution, we must define which variables should be treated symbolically. While we only want to compute the discriminator value of the union, all arguments are symbolized because other arguments of the interface function also influence the program execution flow.</p><p>Symbolic execution can also encounter issues like infinite loops, recursion, or concurrency problems during execution. However, these can be addressed using mechanisms like LOOP_THOLD and CALL_THOLD. It is assumed that all code executes on a single thread, allowing concurrency issues to be ignored. Additionally, COMFUSION checks whether a discriminator can take multiple values whenever a new execution path arises. If it can only take one value, that path is pruned.</p><p><img src="/2025/08/28/ogu123/Detecting%20Union%20Type%20Confusion%20in%20Component%20Object%20Model/EN/13.png" alt></p><p>COMFUSION states that when tracking union variables, tracking is primarily done in three ways:</p><ol><li>When used as a function argument</li><li>When used as an address, like a pointer</li><li>When used in arithmetic and comparison operations</li></ol><p>If a memory address or operand is confirmed to be tainted from a union variable, COMFUSION calculates all possible values the union&#x2019;s discriminator could hold. If it can hold one or more values, COMFUSION determines that union type confusion exists and reports it.</p><p>Based on information obtained through COMFUSION analysis (vulnerability location, union members, discriminators, etc.), we directly write a PoC to reproduce the bug. However, when the arguments of the interface function are complex, we resolve it through fuzzing.</p><p>The goal in Figure 7 is to make an <code>if</code> statement false within the <code>CUxxxame</code> function, thereby executing the <code>while</code> loop. Here, it was known that the <code>Initialize()</code> function modifies the value at <code>this + 0x18</code>, but fuzzing is used because the function arguments are complex. Specifically, they set a breakpoint on the <code>ret</code> instruction in the <code>Initialize()</code> function. If the value at the address <code>this + 0x18</code> is non-zero, they consider this an indication that they have found a suitable argument value capable of executing the vulnerable code.</p><p>The current version of fuzzing requires manually writing the harness, but the goal is to develop a more automated solution in the future.</p><h2 id="Evaluation"><a href="#Evaluation" class="headerlink" title="Evaluation"></a>Evaluation</h2><p><img src="/2025/08/28/ogu123/Detecting%20Union%20Type%20Confusion%20in%20Component%20Object%20Model/EN/14.png" alt></p><p>COMFUSION was developed using Python, PowerShell, C++, and other languages, and also utilized external tools (OleViewDotNet, Angr, Cppcheck, TitanEngine).</p><p>Testing on Windows 10 (1809, 21H2) and Windows 11 (21H2) identified approximately 1,800 sensitive functions out of about 2 million total functions. The 411 sensitive functions discovered on Windows 11 were significantly fewer. This is attributed to compatibility issues where oleviewdotnet failed to properly recognize union types on Windows 11 or classified <code>VARIANT</code> as <code>FC_USER_MARSHAL</code>, preventing the efficient identification of necessary functions.</p><p><img src="/2025/08/28/ogu123/Detecting%20Union%20Type%20Confusion%20in%20Component%20Object%20Model/EN/15.png" alt></p><p>Next, it shows how accurately COMFUSION identifies type confusion. On Windows 10 (1809, 21H2), nearly half were false positives, and on Windows 11, over 70% were false positives.</p><p>Analysis of the cause of the high false positives revealed that when COMFUSION analyzes functions implemented in external libraries, it uses a strategy that checks only four arguments because it does not know the exact number of arguments. If the actual function uses fewer than four arguments, COMFUSION incorrectly recognizes the data stored in the remaining registers as invalid union members.</p><p><img src="/2025/08/28/ogu123/Detecting%20Union%20Type%20Confusion%20in%20Component%20Object%20Model/EN/16.png" alt></p><p>The paper classified the discovered union type confusions into CoP and CoNP. Among the 19 CoPs identified, 5 triggered LPE, while the rest triggered DoS. Although false positives were high, the COMFUSION tool proved effective as it efficiently filtered sensitive functions.</p><h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>Through this paper, I learned that improper use of unions in COM servers can lead to type confusion. While I didn&#x2019;t fully grasp the entire paper, it gave me a fresh perspective on finding vulnerabilities in COM and prompted me to revisit concepts like marshaling and IDL.</p><p>Reading this paper made me realize that even just the introduction of a paper in a field you&#x2019;re interested in can be incredibly helpful.</p><p>Thank you for reading this long post.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h1 id="1-Introduction"><a href="#1-Introduction" class="headerlink" title="1. Introduction"></a>1. Introduction</h1><p>Hello, this is bekim! I was writing articles related to blockchain when I got a job and became too busy, so I will review some papers! I searched for papers from Usenix Security 24 or 25, and chose topics related to blockchain security, which I have been dealing with on a regular basis. So, I will review the papers assuming that the readers of this article have a basic understanding of blockchain.</p><p><img src="/2025/08/25/bekim/review/en/image.png" alt></p><p>Today&#x2019;s review is on a paper titled <strong>Speculative DoS Attacks in Ethereum</strong>. This paper presents a new form of denial-of-service (DoS) attack that could occur in Ethereum. The researchers demonstrate how three main attack methods <strong>(ConditionalExhaust, MemPurge, and GhostTX)</strong> can exploit Ethereum&#x2019;s transaction processing and resource management structure. All experiments were conducted on the Ethereum testnet.</p><h1 id="2-Paper-Review"><a href="#2-Paper-Review" class="headerlink" title="2. Paper Review"></a>2. Paper Review</h1><p>In my previous research paper <a href="https://hackyboiz.github.io/2025/07/13/bekim/smartcontract/en/">From Paper to Code: Smart Contract</a>&#x201D;, I briefly explained the gas mechanism in the section describing how Ethereum works. If you find this concept difficult to understand, you may want to read it first!</p><h2 id="2-1-Background"><a href="#2-1-Background" class="headerlink" title="2.1 Background"></a>2.1 Background</h2><p>Ethereum primarily utilizes the gas mechanism to prevent excessive computation and provides incentives to nodes (validators) operating the network. When executing a transaction, gas must be paid based on the computational load, and this gas has served as a mechanism to protect network resources. Therefore, until now, there has been a perception that DoS attacks are very difficult on Ethereum.</p><p>However, this paper presents a different perspective.</p><p>Due to the Turing-complete nature of smart contracts, nodes must execute a transaction to verify whether it can actually be included in a block.<br>The costs incurred in this process are not compensated by fees unless the transaction is included in the block. In other words, attackers can create malicious transactions that &#x201C;force work but do not provide compensation.&#x201D;</p><p>The paper introduces three new attack techniques to demonstrate this.</p><ul><li><strong>ConditionalExhaust</strong>: A resource exhaustion attack that occurs only under specific conditions.</li><li><strong>MemPurge:</strong> An attack that forces normal transactions out of the validator/builder&#x2019;s mempool.</li><li><strong>GhostTX:</strong> An attack that disrupts the reputation system of Ethereum&#x2019;s PBS (Proposer-Builder Separation) ecosystem.</li></ul><p>In particular, using ConditionalExhaust and Mempurge simultaneously can deplete the computational resources of validators while blocking the mempool, preventing victims from including transactions in blocks. This could result in victims generating empty blocks and threatening the network&#x2019;s activity.</p><h2 id="2-2-Proposed-Attacks"><a href="#2-2-Proposed-Attacks" class="headerlink" title="2.2 Proposed Attacks"></a>2.2 Proposed Attacks</h2><h3 id="2-2-1-The-ConditionalExhaust-Attack"><a href="#2-2-1-The-ConditionalExhaust-Attack" class="headerlink" title="2.2.1 The ConditionalExhaust Attack"></a>2.2.1 The ConditionalExhaust Attack</h3><p>The first attack we will introduce is the ConditionalExhaust attack, a conditional resource depletion attack.</p><p>The core idea of the attack is simple. Validators or block builders following censorship do not include transactions interacting with a specific censored address (&#x3C3;) in the block. This is because, following the 2022 U.S. OFAC (Office of Foreign Assets Control) sanctions against the smart contract address associated with the Tornado Cash mixing service, some Ethereum validators began filtering out transactions related to that address from blocks. The problem is that <strong>to determine whether a transaction is related to a sanctioned entity (&#x3C3;), the transaction must be executed unconditionally</strong>. This execution process is exploited by ConditionalExhaust.</p><p><img src="/2025/08/25/bekim/review/en/image1.png" alt></p><blockquote><p>Complete Overview of Decred&#x2019;s Structure [source: <a href="https://medium.com/decred/blockchain-governance-how-decred-iterates-upon-bitcoin-3cc7030c655e">https://medium.com/decred/blockchain-governance-how-decred-iterates-upon-bitcoin-3cc7030c655e</a>]</p></blockquote><p>Speculative DoS Attacks in Ethereum (USENIX Security 2024): ConditionalExhaust is a conditional REA, in which<br>an attacker creates transactions that invoke computationally complex code if the victim cannot include them in a block, for example due to its censoring policy</p><p>The attack is divided into two main stages.</p><p>First, in the <strong>deployment stage</strong>, the attacker uploads a specially designed smart contract to the blockchain (1).</p><p>This contract contains the following conditions:</p><p>1) If the executor is a censoring validator, perform complex and heavy computations (2). (3)<br>2) If not, it performs simple operations and incurs minimal gas costs.</p><p>This condition is included in the contract.</p><p>Next, in the <strong>execution phase</strong>, the attacker floods the network with multiple transactions calling this contract.</p><p>This causes censors to consume excessive CPU and memory resources for each computation, and only after execution completes do they realize the transaction cannot be included in the block because it interacts with the censored address (&#x3C3;). (4) In other words, resources are wasted without any reward.</p><p>Although there is an implementation overview in the actual paper, I will not include it here due to the possibility of code misuse. Researchers designed the code to maximize resource consumption by modifying various elements, such as Ethereum&#x2019;s storage structure and high-cost opcodes.</p><p>As a result, while it took only microseconds for the attacker to generate and sign transactions, it took an average of 0.1 seconds for the censor to verify them, resulting in a difference of approximately 1,972 times over two hours. In actual Ethereum, a block can process up to 120 transactions in 12 seconds, but if the attacker sends just 140 transactions, it could result in an empty block being generated without including normal transactions.</p><p>The economic cost of the attack was also not significant. Deploying the contract cost $27 (36,000 KRW), and in the worst case, if the attack transactions were included in the block, the cost would be $5.3 (7,000 KRW). Upon actual calculation, the total cost required to execute 140 attack transactions in a single block was only approximately $376 (500,000 KRW).</p><h3 id="2-2-2-The-MemPurge-Attack"><a href="#2-2-2-The-MemPurge-Attack" class="headerlink" title="2.2.2 The MemPurge Attack"></a>2.2.2 The MemPurge Attack</h3><p>The second attack is, as the name suggests, an attack that purges the node&#x2019;s mempool. Ethereum nodes store transactions that may be included in future blocks in a storage called <strong>mempool</strong>, which has limited space, so transactions with higher fees are usually prioritized.</p><p>The attacker exploits this rule to push out profitable legitimate transactions from the mempool and replace them with their own meaningless transactions.<br>The core of the attack is to create a transaction chain (TXchain) with consecutive nonces (numbers).</p><p><img src="/2025/08/25/bekim/review/en/image2.png" alt></p><blockquote><p>Speculative DoS Attacks in Ethereum (USENIX Security 2024): The MemPurge attack lowers the cost to evict transactions from victims&#x2019; mempools.</p></blockquote><p>Speculative DoS Attacks in Ethereum (USENIX Security 2024): The MemPurge attack lowers the cost to evict transactions from victims&#x2019; mempools.</p><p>1) First, the attacker creates the first transaction (nonce=N) to transfer funds from their account to a new address, and then adds meaningless transactions such as Nonce = N+1, N+2, &#x2026; to form a TX Chain. (1)<br>2) The attacker sends subsequent transactions to the victim node (2), and since the victim node receives them without any preceding transactions, it temporarily stores them in the future queue (3).<br>3) Finally, when the attacker sends the first transaction (N), the victim node verifies it and moves the entire previous transaction chain to the pending queue (4).<br>4) However, since the attacker&#x2019;s funds have already been withdrawn in the first transaction, subsequent transactions become invalid due to insufficient balance. As a result, the mempool is filled with meaningless transactions, and the originally profitable transactions are pushed out.</p><ul><li><strong>ConditionalExhaust + MemPurge</strong><br>Mempurge and ConditionalExhaust can be combined. By setting the to address of each MemPurge transaction to ConditionalExhaust, MemPool space is occupied, and ConditionalExhaust consumes computation.</li></ul><p>By calling the ConditionalExhaust contract in the first transaction to impose CPU and memory computation burdens on the censor, and then invalidating subsequent transactions that only occupy mempool space, a more powerful attack can be executed.</p><p>Researchers verified this combined attack and reported that, compared to a single attack, the gas cost remained almost unchanged while maintaining the same effectiveness.</p><h3 id="2-2-3-The-GhostTX-Attack"><a href="#2-2-3-The-GhostTX-Attack" class="headerlink" title="2.2.3 The GhostTX Attack"></a>2.2.3 The GhostTX Attack</h3><p>The GhostTX Attack directly targets the reputation of the Searcher in Flashbots&#x2019; PBS (Proposer-Builder Separation) environment.</p><ul><li><strong>PBS</strong> is a structure that separates the roles of block proposers and builders to efficiently construct blocks. Proposers simply select and submit blocks, while builders create the most profitable transaction combinations (bundles) and submit them to proposers.</li></ul><p><img src="/2025/08/25/bekim/review/en/image3.png" alt></p><blockquote><p>Speculative DoS Attacks in Ethereum (USENIX Security 2024): Overview of Ethereum&#x2019;s PBS ecosystem actors.</p></blockquote><ul><li><strong>Flashbots</strong> is an implementation of PBS, providing a <strong>Relay</strong> service that connects Searchers (participants who create Bundles and deliver them to Builders), Builders, and Proposers. This system has a <strong>Reputation</strong> system that scores Searchers based on their past performance, so Bundles from Searchers with high reputations are selected first.</li></ul><p>Here, reputation is calculated based on <strong>how much profit was generated per gas unit</strong>. Therefore, once reputation drops, the address must be changed to rebuild it, which means attackers can lower the victim&#x2019;s trustworthiness and force them out of the ecosystem.<br>&#x394;T: Amount paid to the Builder, pT: Fee, gT: Gas consumption </p><pre><code class="hljs erlang"><span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-title">r</span><span class="hljs-params">(U)</span> = <span class="hljs-params">(&#x2211; (&#x394;T + pT * gT)</span>) / <span class="hljs-params">(&#x2211; gT)</span></span></code></pre><p><img src="/2025/08/25/bekim/review/en/image4.png" alt></p><blockquote><p>Speculative DoS Attacks in Ethereum (USENIX Security 2024): GhostTX&#x2019;s censorship variant exploits an inconsistency between builder and relay censorship methods</p></blockquote><p>The attack process is divided into <strong>two types (Proposer Variant, Non-proposer Variant)</strong>. Simply put, in the <strong>Proposer Variant</strong>, if the attacker is a block proposer, they spread a bait transaction that appears to be profitable and then invalidate it in the first block to damage the Searcher&#x2019;s reputation.</p><p>In the case of the <strong>Non-Proposer</strong>, the attacker simultaneously spreads a collision transaction with the same nonce and fee as the Searcher&#x2019;s bait transaction, ensuring that only the attacker&#x2019;s transaction is recorded in the block.</p><p>1) The attacker sends a transaction that transfers funds to a sanctioned address (1)<br>2) The Searcher identifies this as a profitable transaction and includes it in the bundle. (2)<br>3) The Builder verifies the bundle (3) and adds the TX to the block (4).<br>4) The block is transmitted to the Relay, but the Relay detects the transaction related to the sanctioned address and discards the block (5), resulting in the Searcher&#x2019;s bundle being invalidated and their Reputation score decreasing. (6)</p><p>The GhostTX Attack can be executed in various ways, one of which is the <strong>Censorship Variant</strong>. This exploits the subtle differences in how Flashbots&#x2019; Builder and Relay perform censorship.</p><p>While Builder&#x2019;s internal verification does not consider 0 ETH transfers using the call operator as sanction targets, Relay&#x2019;s verification API does consider them as such. Attackers can exploit this by creating transactions that send 0 ETH to sanctioned addresses, making them appear as normal transactions to Searcher and Builder, but only getting filtered out at the Relay stage. This results in Searcher&#x2019;s bundles being invalidated again and its Reputation score decreasing.</p><p><img src="/2025/08/25/bekim/review/en/image5.png" alt></p><blockquote><p>Speculative DoS Attacks in Ethereum (USENIX Security 2024): Figure 8: Cost of attacking average searchers with GhostTX</p></blockquote><p>The researchers evaluated the effectiveness of GhostTX attacks based on actual data. For top-tier Searchers, they were generating approximately 8,240 ETH in profits and 112 billion gas usage. To push them out of the top 50% in Reputation, it would require a cost of approximately 42.49 million dollars. While it is practically impossible to realistically bring down established large-scale Searchers, the results were different for average-level Searchers.</p><p>On average, they recorded approximately 0.95 ETH in profits, 3.28 million gas usage, and a Reputation score of 2.9&#xD7;10&#xB9;&#xB9;. It was reported that only 9,820 dollars would be sufficient to push them down to the bottom 60% level. In other words, while the GhostTX attack is difficult to execute against large Searchers, it can relatively cheaply undermine the Reputation of medium-sized Searchers or newly entering Searchers.</p><h1 id="3-Conclusion"><a href="#3-Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="3. Conclusion"></a>3. Conclusion</h1><p>As the authors of the paper also pointed out, there are several practical constraints that prevent the proposed attacks from being directly applied in real-world environments. For example, ConditionalExhaust requires the attacker to spread a large number of transactions simultaneously to maximize its effectiveness, which could incur significant network layer costs in practice. Additionally, there may be discrepancies between the attack costs mentioned in the paper and actual attack costs, leading to varying assessments of the threat level depending on the environment.</p><p>Personally, I wonder how realistic a threat this could be on the mainnet. ConditionalExhaust and MemPurge seem impractical for threatening the mainnet, while GhostTX appears to be a more feasible attack in reality&#x2026;</p><p>The paper does propose mitigations for these attacks, but upon reading them, most seem to either degrade user experience or reduce network efficiency, so they are not yet perfect solutions. In conclusion, while these attacks may not pose an immediate, substantial threat capable of destabilizing the mainnet, the paper does highlight some structural vulnerabilities in Ethereum&#x2019;s architecture.</p><p>Thank you for reading this sudden paper review all the way through! &#x1F64F; I&#x2019;ll be back soon with more interesting topics.</p>]]></content:encoded>

I&#x2019;m newp1ayer48, the one in charge of the low-level at Hackyboiz! &#x1F938;&#x1F3FB;&#x200D;&#x2642;&#xFE0F;</p><p><img src="image1.jpg" alt="image1.jpg"></p><p>When you get into embedded hacking, you encounter binaries and environments from various RISC architectures.</p><p>Most of the time, you&#x2019;ll work with and see the ARM architecture. However, it&#x2019;s also not uncommon to come across MIPS and MIPSEL architectures&#x2026;</p><p>The assembly instructions and registers look unfamiliar from the start, and to top it off, you have to worry about the Cache&#x2026;</p><p>Let&#x2019;s cover the most fundamental aspects needed for exploitation in this somewhat alien MIPS environment!</p><h2 id="1-MIPS-vs-MIPSEL"><a href="#1-MIPS-vs-MIPSEL" class="headerlink" title="1. MIPS vs MIPSEL"></a>1. MIPS vs MIPSEL</h2><p><img src="image2.jpg" alt="image2.jpg"></p><p>MIPS is one of the RISC architectures designed so that registers and instructions perform a single role. Although it has the disadvantage of having many registers, its instructions are simple, leading to low power consumption, which is why it&#x2019;s primarily used in embedded devices.</p><p>Because the MIPS instruction set is so cleanly organized, it&#x2019;s often the architecture taught in university computer architecture courses (that was the case for me)&#x2026;</p><p>MIPS is big-endian, while MIPSEL is little-endian. MIPSEL only adopts the little-endian data storage format, so it operates in the same way as MIPS. Since the commonly used x86-64 architecture also uses this data storage method, you can use pwntools functions in the same way for MIPSEL. Therefore, in a MIPSEL environment, you can use pwntools&#x2019; <code>p32()</code> and <code>p64()</code> functions as they are!</p><h2 id="2-MIPS-Stack-amp-Register"><a href="#2-MIPS-Stack-amp-Register" class="headerlink" title="2. MIPS Stack &amp; Register"></a>2. MIPS Stack &amp; Register</h2><p>Before we dive into exploitation, it&#x2019;s necessary to understand the stack structure and behavior in a MIPS environment.</p><p>The official references for the MIPS architecture are <a href="https://www.cs.cornell.edu/courses/cs3410/2008fa/MIPS_Vol1.pdf">MIPS32 Architecture For Programmers Volume I</a> and the <a href="https://www.cs.unibo.it/~solmi/teaching/arch_2002-2003/AssemblyLanguageProgDoc.pdf">MIPS Assembly Language Programmer&#x2019;s Guide</a>.</p><p>From these, let&#x2019;s cover the knowledge we need from an exploitation perspective. First, here is a list of registers used in MIPS and their roles.</p><div class="table-container"><table><thead><tr><th>&#xC774;&#xB984;</th><th>&#xB808;&#xC9C0;&#xC2A4;&#xD130; &#xBC88;&#xD638;</th><th>&#xC5ED;&#xD560;</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><strong><code>$zero</code></strong></td><td><strong><code>$0</code></strong></td><td>Always returns 0</td></tr><tr><td><strong><code>$at</code></strong></td><td><strong><code>$1</code></strong></td><td>Reserved for assembler to calculate pseudo-instructions</td></tr><tr><td><strong><code>$v0</code> ~ <code>$v1</code></strong></td><td><strong><code>$2</code> ~ <code>$3</code></strong></td><td>Stores values returned from functions</td></tr><tr><td><strong><code>$a0</code> ~ <code>$a3</code></strong></td><td><strong><code>$4</code> ~ <code>$7</code></strong></td><td>Stores function arguments</td></tr><tr><td><strong><code>$t0</code> ~ <code>$t7</code></strong></td><td><strong><code>$8</code> ~ <code>$15</code></strong></td><td>Used for temporary value storage by the assembler or language</td></tr><tr><td><strong><code>$s0</code> ~ <code>$s7</code></strong></td><td><strong><code>$16</code> ~ <code>$23</code></strong></td><td>Used to store long-lasting values (callee-saved)</td></tr><tr><td><strong><code>$t8</code> ~ <code>$t9</code></strong></td><td><strong><code>$24</code> ~ <code>$25</code></strong></td><td>Used for temporary value storage by the assembler or language</td></tr><tr><td><strong><code>$k0</code> ~ <code>$k1</code></strong></td><td><strong><code>$26</code> ~ <code>$27</code></strong></td><td>Reserved for the OS kernel</td></tr><tr><td><strong><code>$gp</code></strong></td><td><strong><code>$28</code></strong></td><td>Stores the value of the global pointer</td></tr><tr><td><strong><code>$sp</code></strong></td><td><strong><code>$29</code></strong></td><td>Stores the value of the stack pointer</td></tr><tr><td><strong><code>$fp</code>/<code>$s8</code></strong></td><td><strong><code>$30</code></strong></td><td>Stores the value of the frame pointer</td></tr><tr><td><strong><code>$ra</code></strong></td><td><strong><code>$31</code></strong></td><td>Stores the return address</td></tr></tbody></table></div><p>The registers to pay close attention to are <code>$ra</code>, <code>$sp</code>, and <code>$s8</code>.</p><p>In MIPS, the <code>$ra</code> register holds the function&#x2019;s return address. It&#x2019;s helpful to think of it as serving the role of <code>RET</code> in x86/x64.</p><pre><code class="hljs nasm">0x00400734 &lt;main+0&gt;:    addiu   sp,sp,-1360x00400738 &lt;main+4&gt;:    sw      ra,132(sp)0x0040073c &lt;main+8&gt;:    sw      s8,128(sp)0x00400740 &lt;main+12&gt;:   move    s8,sp...0x004007d8 &lt;main+164&gt;:  move    sp,s80x004007dc &lt;main+168&gt;:  lw      ra,132(sp)0x004007e0 &lt;main+172&gt;:  lw      s8,128(sp)0x004007e4 &lt;main+176&gt;:  addiu   sp,sp,1360x004007e8 &lt;main+180&gt;:  jr      ra</code></pre><p>The structure works by saving the return address from the <code>$ra</code> register onto the stack during the function prologue and then jumping to the return address in the <code>$ra</code> register during the function epilogue.</p><p>The <code>$ra</code> register&#x2019;s value is saved to the stack relative to the <code>$sp</code> (current stack pointer) and <code>$s8</code> (frame pointer). Therefore, the first step in stack-based exploitation is to calculate the offset by determining the buffer&#x2019;s starting position and the return address&#x2019;s location relative to the <code>$sp</code> register.</p><pre><code class="hljs nasm">lw      $s2, 24(sp)      ; Load value at sp+24 into $s2 (address of &amp;&quot;/bin/sh&quot;)lw      $s1, 20(sp)      ; Load value at sp+20 into $s1 (address of &amp;system)lw      $s0, 16(sp)      ; Load value at sp+16 into $s0 (address of &amp;sleep)lw      $ra, 28(sp)      ; Load value at sp+28 into $ra (address of the next gadget)addiu   sp, sp, 32       ; Clean up the stack pointerjr      $ra              ; Jump to $ra (the next gadget)</code></pre><p>The gadget form needed for the Shellcode and ROP chains, which will be explained later, is shown above.</p><p>The most basic form involves loading values from the stack into the <code>$s0-$s7</code> registers using the <code>lw</code> instruction, cleaning up the stack pointer with <code>addiu</code>, and then jumping to the return address with <code>jr</code>.</p><p>Since this is the most basic form, you can combine the necessary arguments and instructions to fit the specific situation and environment.</p><pre><code class="hljs nasm">move    $t9, $s1         ; Move $s1 (system address) to $t9 (register for calls)jalr    $t9              ; Jump to the address in $t9</code></pre><p>Function execution is performed via the <code>jalr</code> instruction. You can understand it as working like the call instruction in x86-64.</p><h2 id="3-Cache-Incoherency"><a href="#3-Cache-Incoherency" class="headerlink" title="3. Cache Incoherency"></a>3. Cache Incoherency</h2><p>When exploiting a real device configured with a MIPS environment, you&#x2019;ll sometimes need to use shellcode due to the nature of IoT/embedded devices. However, there&#x2019;s a crucial point to be aware of when using shellcode in a MIPS environment.</p><p>That is the Cache.</p><p><img src="image3.png" alt="image3.png"></p><p>MIPS uses two types of caches: the Instruction Cache, which holds opcodes, and the Data Cache, which records data.</p><p>The problem, known as Cache Incoherency, occurs because the value we input (our shellcode) goes into the Data Cache, but the CPU tries to execute instructions from the existing Instruction Cache.</p><p>To solve this, we need to bring the data from the Data Cache to the Instruction Cache. This process, depending on the cache write policy, involves synchronizing with memory and then invalidating the Instruction Cache. The important part here is that we need to flush the Data Cache to force a cache write.</p><p><img src="image4.png" alt="image4.png"></p><p>The state of memory and the caches after the Data Cache has been flushed is shown above. Since the instructions in the Instruction Cache and memory are no longer identical, the Instruction Cache is invalidated. Then, the code from the Data Cache, now synchronized with memory, is executed.</p><p>Only by going through this process can we create a flow where the shellcode we&#x2019;ve inserted can actually be executed.</p><p><img src="image5.png" alt="image5.png"></p><p>The easiest way to achieve this is by calling the <code>sleep()</code> function.</p><p>When <code>sleep()</code> is called, execution is passed to another process or thread, causing other data to be generated in the Data Cache. Later, according to the cache write policy, a flush occurs, and the data residing in memory is also written to the Data Cache.</p><p>Therefore, if you&#x2019;re using shellcode in a MIPS environment, it&#x2019;s a good practice to structure your exploit by calling <code>sleep()</code>.</p><h2 id="4-MIPS-Exploit-Practice"><a href="#4-MIPS-Exploit-Practice" class="headerlink" title="4.

This is my first time greeting you with an article on Windows Minifilter Drivers. &#x1F917;</p><p>While studying Windows Kernel Drivers recently, I discovered that there are various types of drivers categorized by purpose, such as Bus Drivers, Filter Drivers, FSDs, and Minifilters. I became curious about the structural differences between Bus or Filter Drivers and traditional Function Drivers, as well as how vulnerabilities manifest in these different types.</p><p>Today, we will explore the structure and operation of Minifilter Drivers, examine their internal components, and analyze potential vulnerabilities.</p><p><img src="/2025/08/15/banda/Minifilter-Driver/en/image1.png" alt></p><h1 id="1-About-Minifilter-Drivers"><a href="#1-About-Minifilter-Drivers" class="headerlink" title="1.

About Minifilter Drivers</h1><hr><p>A Minifilter driver is a specialized type of driver in Windows designed to monitor, intercept, and modify file system I/O requests such as file creation, opening, reading, writing, and deletion. It is commonly used for precise monitoring of file system activity.</p><p>If you think about it in terms of <strong>&#x201C;monitoring, blocking, or modifying file access&#x201D;</strong>, it starts to sound familiar, doesn&#x2019;t it? Indeed &#x2014; this functionality is well-suited for products like <strong>antivirus software, EDR solutions, and backup programs</strong>. In fact, I&#x2019;ve personally confirmed that many such products rely on Minifilter drivers.</p><p>A Minifilter driver can intercept or manipulate the following three types of requests:</p><ol><li>IRP (I/O Request Packet)</li><li>Fast I/O</li><li>File System Filter Callbacks</li></ol><h2 id="1-1-Filter-Manager-&#x2192;-Minifilter-Flow"><a href="#1-1-Filter-Manager-&#x2192;-Minifilter-Flow" class="headerlink" title="1.1 Filter Manager &#x2192; Minifilter Flow"></a>1.1 Filter Manager &#x2192; Minifilter Flow</h2><p>A Minifilter operates on top of the Windows Filter Manager (<code>fltmgr.sys</code>). The Filter Manager receives file I/O requests from the I/O Manager and forwards them to the registered Minifilter drivers in the order determined by their <strong>altitude</strong>. In other words, the altitude controls the order in which filters are loaded and invoked.</p><p><img src="/2025/08/15/banda/Minifilter-Driver/en/image2.gif" alt></p><p>Let&#x2019;s take a look at how file I/O requests are processed in Windows.</p><ol><li>An application issues an I/O operation by calling APIs such as <code>CreateFile</code>, <code>ReadFile</code>, or <code>WriteFile</code>.</li><li>The I/O Manager receives this request and forwards it to the Filter Manager (<code>fltmgr.sys</code>).</li><li>The Filter Manager checks the list of all registered Minifilter drivers and passes the request to each driver in the order of their altitude.</li><li>After the Minifilter completes its processing, the request is passed on to the file system filter driver.</li><li>Finally, the request is delivered to the disk driver (Storage Driver Stack), which accesses the physical disk or processes the data accordingly.</li></ol><p><img src="/2025/08/15/banda/Minifilter-Driver/en/image3.png" alt></p><p>You can check the list of Minifilter drivers loaded on the system by running the <code>fltmc</code> command in the Command Prompt.</p><p>The higher the altitude value, the higher the priority, meaning the Minifilter can intercept or modify I/O requests earlier. However, the processing order differs depending on whether it is a pre-operation or post-operation callback.</p><ul><li><strong>Pre-operation</strong>: Called in <strong>descending altitude order</strong> (high &#x2192; low)</li><li><strong>Post-operation</strong>: Called in <strong>ascending altitude order</strong> (low &#x2192; high)</li></ul><p>Looking back at the overall flow&#x2026; a Minifilter driver does not directly handle IRPs in the traditional way.</p><p>Instead, the Filter Manager receives I/O requests on its behalf and passes them to the Minifilter through callback functions.</p><p>In other words, a Minifilter driver does <strong>not</strong> need to set up the <strong>DispatchRoutine</strong> that we commonly associate with traditional drivers!</p><h2 id="1-2-Minifilter-Callback-Routine"><a href="#1-2-Minifilter-Callback-Routine" class="headerlink" title="1.2 Minifilter Callback Routine"></a>1.2 Minifilter Callback Routine</h2><p>How can a Minifilter driver operate only on specific file operations?</p><p>This is possible thanks to a mechanism called <strong>callbacks</strong>.</p><p>As mentioned earlier, a Minifilter driver does <strong>not</strong> directly process IRPs through a <code>DispatchRoutine</code>.</p><p>Instead, it can &#x201C;hook&#x201D; I/O requests delivered via the Filter Manager.</p><p>By registering <strong>pre-operation (<code>PreOperation Callback</code>)</strong> and <strong>post-operation (<code>PostOperation Callback</code>)</strong> callbacks, a Minifilter can monitor or control I/O operations at the system level when they occur.</p><ul><li><strong>Pre-operation callback (<code>PFLT_PRE_OPERATION_CALLBACK</code>)</strong></li></ul><pre><code class="hljs c">PFLT_PRE_OPERATION_CALLBACK PfltPreOperationCallback;<span class="hljs-function">FLT_PREOP_CALLBACK_STATUS <span class="hljs-title">PfltPreOperationCallback</span><span class="hljs-params">(</span></span><span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-params">  [in, out] PFLT_CALLBACK_DATA Data,</span></span><span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-params">  [in]      PCFLT_RELATED_OBJECTS FltObjects,</span></span><span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-params">  [out]     PVOID *CompletionContext</span></span><span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-params">)</span></span><span class="hljs-function"></span>{...}</code></pre><p>Called before the I/O request is passed to the file system or lower drivers.</p><p>This is where the core logic of the Minifilter runs, with powerful capabilities such as returning</p><p><code>FLT_PREOP_COMPLETE</code>, <code>FLT_PREOP_SUCCESS_WITH_CALLBACK</code>, or <code>FLT_PREOP_SUCCESS_NO_CALLBACK</code>.</p><p><a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/fltkernel/nc-fltkernel-pflt_pre_operation_callback"><strong>PFLT_PRE_OPERATION_CALLBACK callback function (fltkernel.h)</strong></a></p><ul><li><strong>Post-operation callback (<code>PFLT_POST_OPERATION_CALLBACK</code>)</strong></li></ul><pre><code class="hljs c">PFLT_POST_OPERATION_CALLBACK PfltPostOperationCallback;<span class="hljs-function">FLT_POSTOP_CALLBACK_STATUS <span class="hljs-title">PfltPostOperationCallback</span><span class="hljs-params">(</span></span><span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-params">  [in, out]      PFLT_CALLBACK_DATA Data,</span></span><span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-params">  [in]           PCFLT_RELATED_OBJECTS FltObjects,</span></span><span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-params">  [in, optional] PVOID CompletionContext,</span></span><span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-params">  [in]           FLT_POST_OPERATION_FLAGS Flags</span></span><span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-params">)</span></span><span class="hljs-function"></span>{...}</code></pre><p>Called on the way back after the I/O request has been fully processed by lower drivers and the file system.</p><p>It is typically used to verify the success of the operation, log results, or modify the outcome if needed.</p><p><a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/fltkernel/nc-fltkernel-pflt_post_operation_callback"><strong>PFLT_POST_OPERATION_CALLBACK callback function (fltkernel.h)</strong></a></p><p>In short, these callbacks are registered in the <code>FLT_OPERATION_REGISTRATION</code> structure, which specifies <strong>which pre-/post-operation callbacks are associated with which I/O operations (MajorFunctions)</strong>.</p><hr><h2 id="1-3-Communication-Between-Minifilter-and-User-Mode"><a href="#1-3-Communication-Between-Minifilter-and-User-Mode" class="headerlink" title="1.3 Communication Between Minifilter and User-Mode"></a>1.3 Communication Between Minifilter and User-Mode</h2><p>Communication between a Minifilter driver and a User-Mode application is handled via a <strong>filter communication port</strong>.</p><p>This port acts as a dedicated high-speed communication channel between the Minifilter and the application, allowing safe message exchange between Kernel-Mode drivers and User-Mode processes.</p><p>Let&#x2019;s look into the code and explore the APIs provided by Microsoft for this purpose.</p><h3 id="Driver-Code"><a href="#Driver-Code" class="headerlink" title="Driver Code"></a>Driver Code</h3><pre><code class="hljs c"><span class="hljs-meta">#<span class="hljs-meta-keyword">include</span> <span class="hljs-meta-string">&lt;fltKernel.h&gt;</span></span>PFLT_FILTER gFilter = <span class="hljs-literal">NULL</span>;PFLT_PORT gServerPort = <span class="hljs-literal">NULL</span>, gClientPort = <span class="hljs-literal">NULL</span>;<span class="hljs-function">VOID <span class="hljs-title">OnDisconnect</span><span class="hljs-params">(PVOID Cookie)</span> </span>{    UNREFERENCED_PARAMETER(Cookie);

Since ALPC and WNF might be unfamiliar concepts, here is a brief explanation of the two subsystems relevant to this exploit:</p><blockquote><p><strong>ALPC (Asynchronous Local Procedure Call)</strong></p></blockquote><p><img src="/2025/08/15/banda/Minifilter-Driver/en/image13.webp" alt></p><p>ALPC is an inter-process communication (IPC) mechanism within the Windows kernel that uses client and server ports to exchange messages. By leveraging the <code>_ALPC_HANDLE_ENTRY</code> in the ALPC handle table, it is possible to store message buffer addresses. Since the size of this table is variable, it allows the creation of kernel objects of arbitrary size.</p><ul><li>When an ALPC port is created, an <code>_ALPC_HANDLE_TABLE</code> is allocated in the <strong>paged pool</strong> with a size of 0x80.</li><li>Each call to <code>NtAlpcCreateResourceReserve</code> creates a <code>_KALPC_RESERVE</code> object, and its address is added to the handle table.</li><li><p>By tampering with this structure, it becomes possible to obtain arbitrary kernel address read/write primitives.</p><p>  &#x2192; In the PoC, a fake <code>_KALPC_RESERVE</code> is injected to achieve arbitrary R/W.</p></li><li><p>ALPC handles can also be controlled from user mode, making them highly useful for exploitation.</p></li></ul><blockquote><p><strong>WNF (Windows Notification Facility)</strong></p></blockquote><p><img src="/2025/08/15/banda/Minifilter-Driver/en/image14.webp" alt></p><p>WNF is the Windows Notification Facility, and the <code>WNF_NAME_INSTANCE</code> kernel object contains an internal <code>_WNF_STATE_DATA</code> field whose size is variable. This allows direct control of the kernel object size from user mode using <code>NtCreateWnfStateName</code> + <code>NtUpdateWnfStateData</code>.</p><ul><li><code>_WNF_STATE_DATA</code> can be allocated with a size of 0x1000 (0x10 header + 0xFF0 data).</li><li>WNF objects can be mass-created for heap spraying, placing them adjacent to a target structure (e.g., an ALPC object).</li><li>In the PoC, WNF is used to create heap holes and then place them next to ALPC objects to trigger an overflow into the ALPC handle table.</li></ul><p>In particular, the PoC required registering a routine to create a pipe, which I found interesting.</p><pre><code class="hljs c"><span class="hljs-class"><span class="hljs-keyword">struct</span> <span class="hljs-title">PipeAttribute</span> {</span>    LIST_ENTRY <span class="hljs-built_in">list</span>;    <span class="hljs-keyword">char</span> *AttributeName;    <span class="hljs-keyword">uint64_t</span> AttributeValueSize;    <span class="hljs-keyword">char</span> *AttributeValue;    <span class="hljs-keyword">char</span> data[<span class="hljs-number">0</span>];};</code></pre><p>The pipe is configured so that the <code>AttributeValue</code> pointer in the modified <code>PipeAttribute</code> structure is set to a kernel memory address. This causes the kernel to read data from that address and return it to user mode. By combining the memory layout control achieved via ALPC with the WNF overflow, the pipe can be turned into an arbitrary read primitive, allowing leakage of kernel addresses.</p><h1 id="3-Conclusion"><a href="#3-Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="3.

Conclusion</h1><hr><p><img src="/2025/08/15/banda/Minifilter-Driver/en/image15.gif" alt></p><p>I&#x2019;ll wrap up by sharing the results of the LPE I implemented using the characteristics of the <code>cldflt.sys</code> Minifilter driver combined with the WNF + ALPC technique.</p><p>While studying Minifilters, I realized that although their operation, functions, and concepts may feel a bit unfamiliar, the way vulnerabilities are triggered and their root causes are, in the end, quite similar. So, there&#x2019;s no need to be too intimidated about diving into Minifilter exploitation!</p><p>If I get the chance, I&#x2019;d like to explore and study various other drivers I haven&#x2019;t looked into yet.

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h1 id="1-Introduction"><a href="#1-Introduction" class="headerlink" title="1. Introduction"></a>1. Introduction</h1><p>It&#x2019;s been a while since my last post, but I&#x2019;m back! I originally told my team, &#x201C;I&#x2019;m going to analyze all of the Usenix papers using LLM and analyze the trends!&#x201D; But&#x2026; well&#x2026; that was wishful thinking, wasn&#x2019;t it? As expected, real life is not going so easy.</p><p><img src="/2025/08/11/j0ker/llm_part3/en/1.jpg" alt="index_img"></p><blockquote><p>When will slaves be able to be happy?</p></blockquote><p>So, I brought another paper this time. If you thought, &#x201C;Oh, this is something anyone would think of&#x201D; about the previous paper, this paper immediately made me think, &#x201C;Oh, this one is a little different.&#x201D; While other papers focused on the inference output of LLM through prompting, RAG, etc., this paper stood out in that it utilized the structure of LLM itself.</p><p>It is &#x201C;<a href="https://arxiv.org/html/2410.15288v1">Attention Is All You Need for LLM-based Code Vulnerability Localization,</a>&#x201D; which was published on Arxiv in October 2024. It seems that it was not submitted to any academic conference but only uploaded to the archive. The idea itself is good, but I think the conclusion part is a little disappointing.</p><h1 id="2-Paper-Review"><a href="#2-Paper-Review" class="headerlink" title="2. Paper Review"></a>2. Paper Review</h1><p>As the title &#x201C;Attention Is All You Need for LLM-based Code Vulnerability Localization&#x201D; suggests, this paper focuses on how the self-attention mechanism of LLM can be used to identify vulnerability locations. It is also an interesting point that the paper pays homage to &#x201C;Attention Is All You Need,&#x201D; which serves as the foundation for current LLMs. &#x1F604;</p><h2 id="2-1-Limitations-of-Existing-Methods"><a href="#2-1-Limitations-of-Existing-Methods" class="headerlink" title="2.1 Limitations of Existing Methods"></a>2.1 Limitations of Existing Methods</h2><h3 id="1-Lost-in-the-Middle"><a href="#1-Lost-in-the-Middle" class="headerlink" title="1) Lost in the Middle"></a>1) Lost in the Middle</h3><p>Before delving into the details, the paper points out that the biggest limitation of LLM in vulnerability detection is the &#x201C;decrease in inference accuracy in long contexts.&#x201D; It is said that when the code exceeds 300 lines, the accuracy drops below 5%.</p><p><img src="/2025/08/11/j0ker/llm_part3/en/2.png" alt="index_img"></p><p>The papers cited as evidence are as follows.</p><ul><li><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2307.03172">Lost in the Middle: How Language Models Use Long Contexs</a></li><li><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2406.10149">BABILong: Testing the Limits of LLMs with Long Context Reasoning-in-a-Haystack</a></li></ul><p>However, you probably don&#x2019;t want to read all these papers while reading this article, right? There is a YouTube channel that covers a similar topic, so you may want to check it out.</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbN_DWM3DJc">OpenAI, Google, Claude are all the same&#x2026; Performance drops much more than expected as input length increases - How to respond | Context Engineering</a></li></ul><p>I haven&#x2019;t read the above content in detail, but it seems to be an issue where, as the number of tokens unrelated to the core content increases, the model fails to accurately focus on the content that requires attention. This is a problem that anyone who has used LLM services extensively, especially those who have tested them with long code snippets for vulnerability detection, has likely encountered at least once. When asking to identify vulnerabilities across multiple functions, issues such as forgetting or failing to recall the code may arise. However, I have noticed that these issues have improved significantly since late last year to early this year. Additionally, papers addressing these issues are beginning to emerge.</p><p>(This information was found by LLM. lol)</p><ol><li>Training method for finding information regardless of location</li></ol><ul><li>&#x201C;Never Lost in the Middle: Mastering Long-Context Question Answering with Position-Agnostic Decompositional Training&#x201D; (2024)<ul><li>Key points: To address this issue, we propose a new training method called &#x201C;Position-Agnostic Decompositional Training.&#x201D; Long questions are decomposed into multiple short questions, and the positions of the correct answers are intentionally mixed to train the model.</li><li>Solution: This reduces the model&#x2019;s reliance on the &#x2018;location&#x2019; of information and enhances its ability to find the necessary information regardless of context.</li></ul></li></ul><ol><li>Changing the structure of input data</li></ol><ul><li>&#x201C;Structured Packing in LLM Training Improves Long Context Utilization&#x201D; (2023)<ul><li>Key points: Instead of simply concatenating multiple documents in order for training, this method proposes providing the model with information that is structurally grouped (packing) together.</li><li>Solution: Strengthens the logical connectivity of information to help the model better understand and utilize information in the middle of the context.</li></ul></li></ul><ol><li>Improving the attention mechanism</li></ol><ul><li>&#x201C;Mixture-of-Recursions: Learning Dynamic Recursive Depths for Adaptive Token-Level Computation&#x201D; (2025)<ul><li>Key Points: Instead of treating all tokens equally, we propose the MoR (Mixture-of-Recursions) architecture, which identifies important tokens through a &#x201C;router&#x201D; and dynamically allocates more computations to those tokens.</li><li>Solution: By focusing computational resources on importance rather than location, we ensure that even core information in the middle of the context is processed deeply without being overlooked.</li></ul></li></ul><ol><li>Combination and Comparison with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)</li></ol><ul><li>&#x201C;Long Context vs. RAG for LLMs: An Evaluation and Revisits&#x201D; (2025)<ul><li>Key Points: This paper compares and analyzes the &#x201C;Long Context&#x201D; approach, which inputs the entire long context, and the RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) approach, which retrieves only the necessary information from an external database.</li><li>Solution: RAG demonstrates that it can be an effective alternative to avoid the &#x201C;Lost in the Middle&#x201D; problem by initially &#x201C;searching&#x201D; for only the necessary information and presenting it at the beginning of the context. However, the analysis concludes that which method is superior depends on the type of task.</li></ul></li></ul><p>Looking at the above papers, we can see that research is being conducted to solve this problem in various aspects, such as training processes, training datasets, attention mechanisms, and context.</p><h3 id="2-Accuracy"><a href="#2-Accuracy" class="headerlink" title="2) Accuracy"></a>2) Accuracy</h3><p>The fundamental problem with LLM is the accuracy of the output results. Of course, it has improved significantly since ChatGPT 3.5 was first released, but false positives and false negatives still exist. To address this, the following advanced reasoning techniques have been employed:</p><ul><li><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2203.11171">SELF-CONSISTENCY IMPROVES CHAIN OF THOUGHT REASONING IN LANGUAGE MODELS</a></li><li><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.06195">MUTUAL REASONING MAKES SMALLER LLMS STRONGER PROBLEM-SOLVERS</a></li></ul><p>However, even these advanced prompting and CoT techniques rely on stochastic decoding to utilize multiple outputs for majority voting or scoring, which are considered incomplete methods.</p><ul><li>Stochastic decoding is one of the ways LLMs generate text, where tokens are randomly sampled from a calculated probability distribution. In other words, it does not always select the token with the highest probability but gives each token a chance to be selected proportional to its probability.</li><li>Conversely, deterministic decoding simply selects the token with the highest probability, ensuring the same output for the same input every time, but it can generate repetitive and less creative results.</li></ul><p>&#x201C;Due to this randomness, improvements in accuracy are minimal, and it is difficult to pinpoint the exact location of vulnerabilities!&#x201D; This is the second issue raised in this paper.</p><h2 id="2-2-Hypotheses-and-Experiments"><a href="#2-2-Hypotheses-and-Experiments" class="headerlink" title="2.2 Hypotheses and Experiments"></a>2.2 Hypotheses and Experiments</h2><h3 id="1-Hypotheses"><a href="#1-Hypotheses" class="headerlink" title="1) Hypotheses"></a>1) Hypotheses</h3><ol><li><p>When searching for vulnerable code, attention is focused on specific lines.</p></li><li><p>If instructed to search for vulnerabilities on specific lines, attention becomes stronger, potentially improving accuracy.</p></li><li><p>Lines containing vulnerabilities will influence the model&#x2019;s output.</p></li><li><p>Highlighting lines without vulnerabilities will not affect the results.</p></li></ol><h3 id="2-Experiment"><a href="#2-Experiment" class="headerlink" title="2) Experiment"></a>2) Experiment</h3><p>The paper first tests whether self-attention can be used to identify the location of vulnerabilities.</p><pre><code class="hljs yaml"><span class="hljs-attr">Code:</span>    <span class="hljs-string">....</span> <span class="hljs-attr">8:</span>     <span class="hljs-string">glyphs</span> <span class="hljs-string">=</span> <span class="hljs-string">(cairo_glyph_t</span> <span class="hljs-string">*)</span> <span class="hljs-string">gmalloc</span> <span class="hljs-string">(len</span>    <span class="hljs-string">*</span> <span class="hljs-string">sizeof</span> <span class="hljs-string">(cairo_glyph_t));</span> <span class="hljs-attr">9:</span>     <span class="hljs-string">glyphCount</span> <span class="hljs-string">=</span> <span class="hljs-number">0</span><span class="hljs-string">;</span><span class="hljs-attr">10:</span> <span class="hljs-string">}</span><span class="hljs-string">Pay</span> <span class="hljs-string">attention</span> <span class="hljs-string">to</span> <span class="hljs-string">line</span> {<span class="hljs-number">8</span>}<span class="hljs-string">.</span> <span class="hljs-string">Check</span> <span class="hljs-string">whether</span> <span class="hljs-string">there</span> <span class="hljs-string">are</span> <span class="hljs-string">vulnerabilities</span> <span class="hljs-string">in</span> <span class="hljs-string">it.</span><span class="hljs-attr">vulnerable line:</span> <span class="hljs-string">```</span></code></pre><p>To find vulnerabilities, write a prompt as shown above. When predicting words after ```, the code with vulnerabilities will receive the highest attention, right? Not only that, but it also tells you which line it is, maximizing the change in weight and allowing you to observe the change.</p><p><img src="/2025/08/11/j0ker/llm_part3/en/3.png" alt="index_img"></p><p>When testing with actual code without vulnerabilities and code with artificially inserted vulnerabilities based on the former,</p><ol><li>Upon checking the attention of code with and without vulnerabilities, it was found that, except for the 70th line where the vulnerability exists, the weights of other lines were high, indicating that the vulnerability was not properly identified.</li><li>When highlighting the 70th line to check the attention in both the code without vulnerabilities and the code with vulnerabilities, the weight of the 70th line increased slightly, and in the code with actual vulnerabilities, the weight was even higher.</li></ol><p>As shown above, this simple test demonstrates that vulnerabilities can be identified to some extent.</p><h1 id="3-LOVA-LO-cating-Vulnerabilities-via-Attention"><a href="#3-LOVA-LO-cating-Vulnerabilities-via-Attention" class="headerlink" title="3. LOVA(LO-cating Vulnerabilities via Attention)"></a>3. LOVA(LO-cating Vulnerabilities via Attention)</h1><p><img src="/2025/08/11/j0ker/llm_part3/en/4.png" alt="index_img"></p><p>The LOVA proposed in this paper compares the weights of unhighlighted code and highlighted code based on the results of the experiments described above to ultimately identify the code lines with the highest probability of containing vulnerabilities.</p><p>It is divided into three stages: Code Line Highlight, Attention Calculation, and Vulnerability Line Localization. Let&#x2019;s take a closer look at each one!</p><h2 id="3-1-Code-Line-Highlight"><a href="#3-1-Code-Line-Highlight" class="headerlink" title="3.1 Code Line Highlight"></a>3.1 Code Line Highlight</h2><p>LOVA creates two versions of prompts. One is the original code with no modifications (Base prompt), and the other is a version where each line of code is highlighted one by one (Highlighted prompts). If the code has 100 lines, one original prompt and 100 highlighted prompts are generated.</p><p>However, there is one problem here. Simply adding a comment like &#x201C;// Take a look here!&#x201D; or inserting specific keywords causes the LLM to ignore the code when it becomes long, or even causes hallucinations, mistaking normal code for vulnerable code.</p><p>Therefore, in LOVA, we directly specify the <strong>code line index</strong>. We add numbers to the front of the code and explicitly state in the prompt, &#x201C;Focus on line 8 and check for vulnerabilities!&#x201D;</p><h2 id="3-2-Attention-Calculation"><a href="#3-2-Attention-Calculation" class="headerlink" title="3.2 Attention Calculation"></a>3.2 Attention Calculation</h2><p>Next, we need to quantitatively calculate how the LLM&#x2019;s &#x2018;attention&#x2019; changes when each line is highlighted. The attention data output by the LLM is an enormous tensor in the form of (num_tokens, num_tokens, num_layers, num_heads).  The paper mentions that even a 1,000-token code can generate hundreds of millions of data points&#x2026; So, analyzing it myself might be faster, right?</p><p>LOVA performs dimensionality reduction as follows to retain only the information necessary for vulnerability analysis from this massive dataset.</p><p><img src="/2025/08/11/j0ker/llm_part3/en/5.png" alt="index_img"></p><blockquote><p>Pseudocode for Steps 1 to 4</p></blockquote><ol><li>Summarize the attention of all heads into a single attention map in the form of (num_tokens, num_tokens, num_layers) and merge them.</li><li>Maintain the attention of each layer as they have their own unique meanings.</li><li>Use the last token as a query (Q) to determine how much attention it receives from all previous tokens, and create a matrix of size (num_tokens, num_layers).</li><li>Sum the attention values of all tokens in each line to calculate the total attention value for that line, and create a matrix of size (num_lines, num_layers). This matrix is called LayerwiseAttnMat.</li><li><p>Calculate the difference between the LayerwiseAttnMat of the highlighted prompt and the base prompt to create DiffAttnMat. Instead of looking at the differences across all lines, we extract only the data from the &#x2018;instruction&#x2019; and &#x2018;highlighted line&#x2019; where the actual changes are expected to be the largest, and create the final <code>VulnAttnMat</code>.</p><p> <img src="/2025/08/11/j0ker/llm_part3/en/6.png" alt="image.png"></p></li></ol><h2 id="3-3-Vulnerability-Line-Localization"><a href="#3-3-Vulnerability-Line-Localization" class="headerlink" title="3.3 Vulnerability Line Localization"></a><strong>3.3 Vulnerability Line Localization</strong></h2><p>The final step is to select the lines with actual vulnerabilities based on the patterns in <code>VulnAttnMat</code>. While it is possible to rank them simply by the sum of attention changes, it is difficult to apply consistent criteria across languages because the vulnerability patterns in C and Python are different.  Furthermore, this is just a &#x201C;suspicious ranking,&#x201D; not an accurate judgment such as &#x201C;this line has an 80% probability of being vulnerable!&#x201D; Therefore, LOVA uses a deep learning model called <strong>Bi-LSTM</strong> at this stage. (Ugh&#x2026; it&#x2019;s getting more and more complicated&#x2026;)</p><ol><li>First, we create a long vector from the <code>VulnAttnMat</code> calculated for each line.</li><li>We feed this vector sequence into the Bi-LSTM model as input. The reason we use Bi-LSTM is that when determining whether a specific line (A) is suspicious, it is more accurate to compare it with the attention patterns of the preceding and following lines (B, C). In other words, it considers the context of the entire code in both directions.</li><li>The model ultimately outputs a &#x201C;suspicious score&#x201D; between 0 and 1 for each line, and if this score exceeds 0.5, it is judged to be vulnerable code.</li></ol><h1 id="4-Results"><a href="#4-Results" class="headerlink" title="4. Results"></a>4. Results</h1><p>The tests were conducted using the Big-Vul, SmartFix, and CVEFixes benchmarks, utilizing models with 10B or less, such as Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct, Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2, and Phi3.5-mini-instruct.</p><ul><li>LOVA demonstrated superior vulnerability location identification capabilities compared to existing LLM direct output methods, achieving up to a 5x performance improvement based on F1-score, especially in long code contexts.</li><li>LOVA achieved excellent vulnerability location identification results across various programming languages, showing up to a 14.6x improvement.</li><li>LOVA is applicable to various LLM architectures and shows consistent results.</li></ul><p>Overall, it shows impressive performance. It was also good to compare it with various techniques such as CoT, MoA, and rStar, assuming that the same model was used. Above all, I think the attempt to use the self-attention mechanism for vulnerability detection for the first time is meaningful.</p><h1 id="5-Areas-for-improvement"><a href="#5-Areas-for-improvement" class="headerlink" title="5. Areas for improvement"></a>5. Areas for improvement</h1><ol><li>Lack of comparison with larger models<ul><li>This paper tested using Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct, Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2, and Phi3.5-mini-instruct, but there is no comparison with larger models.<ul><li>To use the method described in this paper, an attention matrix must be created for each code line, which increases the time required and the number of matrices to be computed. I suspect that the hardware was insufficient to handle larger models.</li><li>In that case, it might be worth comparing it with the vanilla output of a larger model. (Oh, maybe I should try that myself&#x2026;) Even if it only comes out as &#x201C;comparable to the vanilla output of a larger model,&#x201D; it would still be meaningful, right?</li></ul></li></ul></li><li>Lack of comparison of power efficiency or computational cost<ul><li>LOVA highlights each code line individually to generate multiple versions of prompts, calculates the differences in attention maps between them, and goes through several other steps. Additionally, dimension reduction and the use of a Bi-LSTM classifier can increase complexity.<ul><li>This paper lacks mention of the time and financial costs incurred when applied to actual large-scale software projects. While dataset comparisons are useful for performance comparisons, it would be helpful to include measurements of how much additional computation is required as the amount of code increases. (The paper mentions that contexts exceeding 4,000 tokens were filtered to comply with LLM input constraints.)</li></ul></li></ul></li></ol><p>Well&#x2026; I&#x2019;ll wrap up this post here. I considered developing it further into a second part&#x2026; but my current life won&#x2019;t allow it. Haha. Then I&#x2019;ll be back for the next part! (Now I really need to watch Usenix&#x2026;)</p>]]></content:encoded>
