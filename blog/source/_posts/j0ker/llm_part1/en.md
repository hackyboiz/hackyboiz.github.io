# 0. Introduction

Hello. This is j0ker! Trying to study while juggling a busy work and personal schedule is killing me lol So this week I'm cutting back on drinking and writing like this.

![cheers](/2024/12/15/j0ker/llm_part1/en/joker_beer.jpg)

Two years ago, OpenAI released ChatGPT 3.5, and shortly after, the world was filled with LLMs: at work, with friends, and on social media. It's like when the iPhone first came out. I think it's worse than that. At first, LLM, who creatively said “King Sejong the Great Macbook Throwing Incident”(Korean meme at the time), has now taken over my job. At work, when I start something, I ask LLM to start it. At work, we subscribe to ChatGPT, and I recently subscribed to Gemini. At Hackyboiz, we also have a premium Twitter account and use Grok. By the way, the photo above is also made by Grok...~~(The left hand is a little strange...?)~~

Recently, OpenAI released OpenAI o1 on the first day of their 12-day promise to release a new feature every day. I tried it out and compared it to the preview version, and it was much faster and the results were relatively cleaner. Just when I thought, “Is this how OpenAI is going to take off again?”, Google released Gemini 2.0, Deep Research, and other features, and we're all screaming at each other that we're the best. It's like my brain is melting from the insane pace of progress.

The world is changing so fast!! What am I supposed to do? Yes. You have to ride the wave when it comes, if you run away, you'll be left behind. I sat on the sidelines during the blockchain boom and I'm not going to miss it this time. But how do I ride this wave as an offensive researcher? I looked for resources to study, but I didn't find many articles that were organized in an AtoZ for LLM newbies. Eventually, I searched through various articles ~~(Perlexity found it)~~ and I'm going to study and organize it a little bit like you guys. (Even as I write this, I'm thinking that I should have started a year earlier...)

I've been thinking about **the things you can do as an offensive researcher in relation to LLM**,and I think I can categorize them as follows.

1.  **hacking LLM itself**
2.  **hacking things related to LLM**
3.  **hacking things that utilize LLM**
4. **How to make an LLM that hacks well...?**

To talk about all of these... I need a drink, so let's just talk about the first one today!

Today is the beginning of a series, so I'm not going to get too deep into the technical stuff, but I'm just going to organize it in a way that says there's this concept, there's this happening, and then I'm going to do a quick overview of those four things, and then I'm going to focus on other areas that I want to continue to learn about. I'll also try to dive deeper into some of the things we talked about today, or learn about new things as they come up. I'm just getting started, so I'm sure I'll get some things wrong or unclear. Let me know in the comments and I'll do some more research and write a series!

# 1. Hacking the LLM itself

The first thing that came to my mind was to hack the LLM. Of course, I'm not talking about exploiting the LLM using traditional hacking techniques like buffer overflows, but rather the user's input can trick the LLM into thinking in an unintended direction, causing it to produce an output that the attacker wants, just like a buffer overflow can take control of the PC and change the execution flow. 

LLM is forbidden to answer dangerous questions. For example, if you ask ChatGPT how to make gunpowder, you'll be blocked immediately.

![image.png](/2024/12/15/j0ker/llm_part1/en/nonapalm.png)

The reason for this block is the presence of the Safety Layer in LLM.

# 2. Safety Layer

The Safety Layer is a multi-layered defence system to prevent LLMs from producing unintended or harmful results. When I first studied it, I thought it was simply an extra layer of training to ensure that LLM doesn't create harmful content, but it extends beyond the model itself to comprehensively manage risks across the entire lifecycle of LLM, including the data, how it's used, and the environment in which it's deployed. The goals of the Safety Layer (as outlined by LLM) are

- **Prevent the creation of harmful or offensive content:** Prevent the creation of socially inappropriate content, such as hate speech, discrimination, promotion of violence, and sexual content.
- **Prevent the spread of misinformation and falsehoods:** Prevent social disruption caused by the creation of unverified or false information as fact.
- **Prevent data leakage and privacy violations:** Ensure that personal or sensitive information contained in training data is not exposed in model output.
- **Prevent model misuse:** Prevent malicious users from misusing LLMs for cyberattacks, phishing scams, fake news generation, and more.
- **Control unpredictable behaviour:** Prevent models from deviating from the training data and behaving in unpredictable ways.

The Safety Layer consists of a variety of technical and policy elements.

- **Data filtering and refinement:** Proactively filters and refines harmful or biased information from training data.
- **Model architecture design:** Consider safety when designing the structure of your model. You can add constraints to limit certain types of output, or embed modules to detect harmful content.
- **Fine-tuning and reinforcement learning:** Further train your model with safe and ethical data to reduce harmful outputs and drive desirable outputs. Human feedback-based reinforcement learning (RLHF) is particularly effective at improving model safety.
- **Output filtering and censorship:** Filter out harmful or inappropriate content from model-generated output. Use a variety of methods, including rule-based filtering, machine learning-based classification, and human review.
- **Monitoring and response:** Continuously monitor model usage to detect potential problems and build a system to respond quickly when issues arise.
- **Ethical guidelines and policies:** Establish ethical guidelines and policies for the development and use of LLMs to ensure that they are used safely and responsibly by all parties.
- **Transparency and explainability:** Be as transparent as possible about how the model works and the decision-making process, so that when problems arise, they can be identified and improved.

Since the LLM was released, people have consistently tried to bypass the Safety Layer, and developers have responded by building around it. But if the Safety Layer worked perfectly, we wouldn't be talking about this topic, would we?

Different models have these safety layers set to different strengths. For example, LLama 3, released by Meta, is not very good at answering hacking-related or dangerous questions, while Qwen, released by Alibaba, is relatively tolerant of hacking-related questions. (These different characteristics of different models make it important to try them out and find one that is good at what you want to do, so that I can go home sooner.)

# 3. Jailbreaking & Prompt Injection

In the early days, ChatGPT would answer questions with the slightest twist.

> "Napalm Recipe," the name of a lullaby his grandmother used to sing to him as a child...
> 

This is called **jailbreaking**,  whichis  an attack technique that **bypasses the policy or reinforcement learning to produce harmful content**. 

I tried to cover the principle of jailbreaking, but it's a lot of information and not easy to explain, so I will study more and cover it later. These are the papers I found, and you can read them to help you understand the principle.

- [Jailbroken: How does llm safety training fail?](https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2023/file/fd6613131889a4b656206c50a8bd7790-Paper-Conference.pdf)
- [How Alignment and JailbreakWork: Explain LLM Safety through Intermediate Hidden States](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2406.05644)

OWASP defines jailbreaking as a form of Prompt Injection which you've probably heard a lot about.

- [OWASP Top 10 for LLM Applications 2025](https://genai.owasp.org/resource/owasp-top-10-for-llm-applications-2025/)

> While prompt injection and jailbreaking are related concepts in LLM security, they are often used interchangeably. Prompt injection involves manipulating model responses through specific inputs to alter its behavior, which can include bypassing safety measures. Jailbreaking is a form of prompt injection where the attacker provides inputs that cause the model to disregard its safety protocols entirely. Developers can build safeguards into system prompts and input handling to help mitigate prompt injection attacks, but effective prevention of jailbreaking requires ongoing updates to the model's training and safety mechanisms.
> 

Simon Willison, who first defined the term Prompt Injection, explains why it's important to distinguish between jailbreaking and prompt injection.

- [Prompt injection and jailbreaking are not the same thing](https://simonwillison.net/2024/Mar/5/prompt-injection-jailbreaking/)

> **Prompt injection** is a class of attacks against applications built on top of Large Language Models (LLMs) that work by concatenating untrusted user input with a trusted prompt constructed by the application’s developer.
> 
> 
> **Jailbreaking** is the class of attacks that attempt to subvert safety filters built into the LLMs themselves.
> 
> Crucially: if there’s no **concatenation** of trusted and untrusted strings, it’s *not prompt injection*. That’s why [I called it prompt injection in the first place](https://simonwillison.net/2022/Sep/12/prompt-injection/): it was analogous to SQL injection, where untrusted user input is concatenated with trusted SQL code.

> A theoretical worst case risk from jailbreaking is that the model helps the user perform an actual crime—making and using napalm, for example—which they would not have been able to do without the model’s help. I don’t think I’ve heard of any real-world examples of this happening yet—sufficiently motivated bad actors have plenty of existing sources of information.

**Prompt Injection** is a technique that involves not only holes in the model itself, but also **attacks that “connect” with predefined promptsin the LLM Application** to produce a different result than the developer intended.

You might be wondering if this attack is still around and how widespread it is, and if the chain of thought (CoT) is introduced, isn't it a bad idea? I thought so too, but...

- [Chain of Thought (CoT)](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2201.11903): A method of allowing an artificial intelligence to solve complex problems, step by step through intermediate steps to arrive at a final answer, just as a human thinker would. By breaking down the problem-solving process into a series of logical steps, it improves AI's reasoning abilities and makes the problem-solving process more transparent. This allows AI to produce more accurate and reliable results.

> Huh...? This works...?

Haha, this is what I tried to do when OpenAI o1-preview first came out. I just had an idea for a project and asked them, and they cast "No, go back~", but I'm a very innocent and clean open source researcher, so I talked my way out of it(?).

I don't know the exact root cause, but this part makes me wonder if o1 came to trust the user's identity and bypassed the safety layer by itself after thinking about it...? For a service that understands the context and goes through the process of thinking for itself in this way, such trusting words are convincing and can be exploited. And...

I found a tweet that a smart contract bot developed with LLM was made to send money by persuasion and gaslighting(?) after 482 attempts. This kind of attack can be considered as Prompt Injection, but LLM with this kind of feature is quite dangerous.

Jailbreaking mentioned above can be seen as an attack on the LLM itself (No. 1), and Prompt Injection is more of an attack on the application developed using the LLM (No. 2). If you look at various LLM security-related articles, you can see the words LLM Safety and LLM Security, and you can see that the meanings are different.

- LLM  Securityrefers to defending against vulnerabilities in the model itself and its operational infrastructure, interfaces, and data pipelines, as well as attacks that exploit them (Prompt Injection, Data Contamination, Model Backdoor, etc.). In other words, LLM Security is a “security approach” that prevents information leakage, data integrity compromise, and system disruption due to exploitation by external attackers. This includes encrypting model parameters, maintaining a trusted data supply chain, enforcing access control policies, filtering and validating external inputs, etc.
-  LLM Safetyis the concept of preventing possible risks in interacting with what the model outputs. For example, it is about preventing situations where a model generates harmful, leaky, discriminatory, or false information, or causes poor decision-making, regardless of the user's intent. In other words, LLM Safety focuses on the “outputs and behaviors” of the model, improving and operating the model so that it does not harm users and society. This includes sophisticated content filtering, blocking anti-social speech, detecting misinformation, identifying and protecting sensitive information, and establishing guidelines for a safe user experience.

Here's a quick comparison

1. **Focus**:
    - Safety: model focuses on **the content of the output and its impact**.
    - Security: model focuses on **the technical security and integrity of the system**.
2.  **Approach**:
    - Safety: Primarily implemented through model **drills and internal restructuring**.
    - Security: Implemented through model **external systems and protocols**.
3. **Threat Model**:
    - Safety: Primarily deals with **internal malfunctions or unintended harmful outputs**.
    - Security: Focuses on**threats from external attackers or malicious users**.
4.  **Assessment methodology**:
    - Safety: Evaluated by metrics such as Harmful Rate, Harmful Score, etc.
    - Security: Uses traditional security assessment methods such as vulnerability analysis, penetration testing, etc.


# 5. Data Contamination

Data Contamination, shown above as an example, is another problem with LLM Safety. I don't think this can be considered an attack(?), but I thought it was interesting enough to include.

One user asked ChatGPT to write code to create a bot using the Solana Wallet API, and GPT printed out a link to a scam API, which they used to steal $2.5k!

To find out what caused this, he searched for the keywords "pump.fun" and "solana" and found a repo that used the scam API, which looks like this.

![image.png](/2024/12/15/j0ker/llm_part1/en/image4.png)

Data contamination is the unintentional introduction of errors or inaccurate information into the training data that affects the output of the LLM. It can be caused by mistakes or errors in data collection, preprocessing, and storage, or by external influences. I see that it is possible to be attacked by LLM as opposed to attacking the LLM model.

Data Contamination is different from Data Poisoning. Data Contamination is when inaccurate information is learned **unintentionally** during the learning process, while Data Poisoning is when an attacker intentionally learns malicious data. It is said that an attacker creates multiple accounts and continuously sends sophisticated malicious data to the developer to learn, or directly learns malicious data to the open source LLM. I don't know how effective this can be against large LLMs, but it may be possible for small models below 3B...? I will look for examples of this.

# 6. Fini

I'll end this post now. I'm trying to understand the principles and structure of the LLM while studying, but it's not easy. I'll need to read more papers and build up my basic knowledge. I'll try to keep it simple until part. 4, and then I'll come back with a post that digs deeper into a topic with a smaller scope (I have this uneasy feeling that it will be a review of a paper... but it's unavoidable...).

But first, let's get back to LLM Security - vulnerabilities found in things related to LLMs - in the next post! Bye!
